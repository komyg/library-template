# Library Template

This is a library starter template.

It uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/) to create the library bundle and export all relevant functions and types.

## Usage

All exported functions and types must be exported inside the `main.ts` file.

To build the library, run `npm run build -w lib`.

To publish the library run `npm publish -w lib`.

## Testing

To test the library, run `npm run test -w lib`.
