# Test Runner

This package was created as a test bed to test the functionality of Library. It is not meant for end users.

Note: don't forget to test the exported library outside of this monorepo, to guarantee that you didn't forget to export everything.

## Running

Execute the command `npm start` to run the test code (the library must be built before you can test, so run `npm run build -w lib` first).
